# NostalgiaRadio
I was making a playlist with nostalgic songs manually but I realized I can make this to do it

Makes playlist with top songs from a given year </br>
add these environment variables if you want to use it: SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET (you get them from spotify developer dashboard)
